# arxiv-switch

A small extension to switch between `../pdf/..` and `../abs/..` on arxiv.


Future work:

1. When switching, back button functionality should be preserved.
2. In case of papers with versions, idk, fix.
3. Prompts?
4. Better extension logo (contributions welcome, good first issue, bragging rights and other shiny things). 
5. Firefox and Microsoft Edge support.
