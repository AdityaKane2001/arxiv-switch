# arxiv-switch

A small extension to switch between `../pdf/..` and `../abs/..` on arxiv.


Future work:

- When switching, back button functionality should be preserved.        
  - the switched tabs show up in Chrome history, but does not work when you hit the back button
- In case of papers with versions, idk, fix.
- Prompts?
- Better extension logo (contributions welcome, good first issue, bragging rights and other shiny things). 
- Firefox and Microsoft Edge support.
